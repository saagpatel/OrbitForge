# OrbitForge

A real-time N-body gravity simulator where you can fling planets, crash stars, and pilot spacecraft through your own solar systems.

Built with Rust (physics) + React/Three.js (visuals) + Tauri 2 (desktop app).

## What You Can Do

**Create** — Place stars, planets, and spacecraft. Drag to set velocity. Build anything from a simple orbit to a full solar system.

**Simulate** — Watch gravity do its thing at up to 8x speed. Velocity Verlet integration keeps things accurate. Collisions merge bodies with momentum/mass/volume conservation.

**Fly** — Select a spacecraft, hit WASD, and thrust around. Shift doubles your power. Plan Hohmann transfers and gravity assists with the built-in tools.

**Explore** — Toggle orbital elements, Lagrange points, Kepler swept areas, gravity field heatmaps, orbital planes, energy graphs, and more. 13 visualization layers in total.

## Scenarios

| Preset | What it is |
|--------|-----------|
| Sun & Earth | The basics |
| Inner Solar System | Mercury through Mars |
| Outer Solar System | Jupiter through Neptune |
| Full Solar System | All 8 planets |
| Binary Star | Two stars in orbit |
| Figure-8 | Three bodies, one elegant loop |
| Inclined Solar | Tilted orbital planes |
| Asteroid Belt | Hundreds of rocks |
| Galaxy Collision | Two spiral galaxies smashing together |

Plus a **procedural generator** for creating custom systems.

## Performance

The physics engine scales automatically:

| Bodies | Algorithm | Complexity |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| < 50 | Brute force | O(n^2) |
| 50 - 500 | Barnes-Hut octree | O(n log n) |
| 500+ | wgpu compute shader | GPU-accelerated |

Simulation runs at 120Hz on a background thread. Rendering is decoupled via requestAnimationFrame.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Pause / Play |
| `R` | Reset |
| `C` | Clear all bodies |
| `Esc` | Deselect |
| `W` `A` `S` `D` | Spacecraft thrust |
| `Shift` | Double thrust |
| `F11` | Screenshot mode |
| `F12` | Take screenshot |

Mouse: click to select, scroll to zoom, drag to orbit camera. In **Place** mode, click to drop a body. Use **Slingshot** mode and drag to set launch velocity.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Physics engine | Rust (Velocity Verlet, Barnes-Hut, wgpu) |
| Desktop shell | Tauri 2 |
| UI framework | React 19 + Zustand |
| 3D renderer | Three.js (bloom, CSS2D labels, InstancedMesh) |
| Build tools | Vite, TypeScript (strict) |

16 Tauri IPC commands bridge the Rust simulation thread and the React frontend.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run in development mode
pnpm exec tauri dev

# Build for production
pnpm exec tauri build
```

Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and the [Tauri 2 prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).

## Normal Dev vs Lean Dev

Use normal dev when you want fastest incremental rebuilds and do not care about local artifact growth.

```bash
pnpm exec tauri dev
```

Use lean dev when you want lower disk usage over long sessions.

```bash
pnpm run dev:lean
```

What lean dev changes:

- Vite cache goes to a temporary directory (`$VITE_CACHE_DIR`) instead of `node_modules/.vite`.
- Rust build output goes to a temporary directory (`$CARGO_TARGET_DIR`) instead of `src-tauri/target`.
- On exit, temporary caches are removed and a targeted heavy-artifact cleanup runs.

Tradeoff:

- Lower disk usage after each session.
- Slower startup on the next run because build caches are intentionally discarded.

Workspace note:

- For best reliability, use a workspace path that does not contain `:`.
- You can run `bash scripts/dev/check-workspace-path.sh` to validate your current path.
- You can migrate to a canonical path with `bash scripts/dev/migrate-to-canonical-path.sh`.

## Cleanup Commands

Targeted cleanup (heavy build artifacts only, keeps dependencies):

```bash
pnpm run clean:heavy
```

Full local cleanup (all reproducible local caches, including dependencies):

```bash
pnpm run clean:local
```

## Verification Commands

Run full local verification with the canonical command list:

```bash
bash .codex/scripts/run_verify_commands.sh
```

Canonical command definitions live in `.codex/verify.commands`.
